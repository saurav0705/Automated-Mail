# Automated-Mail
Automated mail system in which a mail can be send to multiple users all you need is to provide a document conatining mail id's of respective persons whom do you want to send the mail.




#concept between master and weekend file

master file :: contains all the emails whose mail is sent to the users it is just to prevent duplicate same mail to person.
weekend filr :: contains all the person mails to who you want to send the mails. 


workflow:::

delete the master file
open driverFile.py
just give the path of master document and the weekend document
give the credentials in credential.json
it will ask for user from which mail is to be sent
give it the user
and mails will be send and master file will be updated
NOTE:: 1. if running for first time just leave master="" this will create a master file if no master file exist
       2. change the path of json file in credentialDetail.py
       3. do not change the name of the file it should be weekend.txt and master.txt



driverFile.py -> compareFile.py -> fileValidationCheck.py -> mailTemplate.py(calls credentialDetail.py) -> send_mail.py(calls mailBody.py) -> mergeFile.py
